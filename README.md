Iâ€™m a full-stack developer and UI/UX designer skilled in React, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, Python, and PHP. I craft scalable web applications and AI-driven solutions, like chatbots powered by Hugging Face Transformers, with pixel-perfect, user-centric designs. My projects, such as a responsive currency converter and an AI chatbot, demonstrate my ability to deliver innovative, high-quality solutions tailored to your needs.
